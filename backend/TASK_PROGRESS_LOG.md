### Current Status
- Next up: Tasks 18-20 (Context Aggregation, Context Ranking, Chat Orchestrator)
- 85% completion - entering final phase of context aggregation and orchestration

### Key Accomplishments
1. Successfully implemented dual-database architecture foundation
2. Created comprehensive entity extraction and graph building capabilities
3. Built robust transaction management across multiple databases
4. Integrated NER service for automatic entity recognition
5. Implemented error handling and rollback mechanisms

### Notes
- All services are designed with async/await patterns for optimal performance
- Comprehensive test coverage for each component
- Mock implementations allow testing without live database connections
- Ready for production deployment with proper error handling
