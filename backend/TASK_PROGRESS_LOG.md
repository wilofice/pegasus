### Current Status
- 🎉 **100% COMPLETE** - All 20 tasks successfully implemented
- Pegasus Brain Implementation Plan fully executed

### Key Accomplishments
1. Successfully implemented dual-database architecture foundation
2. Created comprehensive entity extraction and graph building capabilities
3. Built robust transaction management across multiple databases
4. Integrated NER service for automatic entity recognition
5. Implemented error handling and rollback mechanisms

### Notes
