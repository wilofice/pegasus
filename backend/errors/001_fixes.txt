Backend Error 001 Fixes Applied - 2025-07-06

✅ FIXED: Neo4j Enterprise Edition Constraint Error

**Issue:** 
Property existence constraint error in neo4j_client.py line 227:
"CREATE CONSTRAINT chunk_audio_id IF NOT EXISTS FOR (c:AudioChunk) REQUIRE c.audio_id IS NOT NULL"
Error: "Property existence constraint requires Neo4j Enterprise Edition"

**Root Cause:**
Property existence constraints (IS NOT NULL) are only available in Neo4j Enterprise Edition,
but the system is running on Community Edition.

**Solution Applied:**
- Commented out the problematic constraint in neo4j_client.py
- Added explanatory comment about Enterprise Edition requirement
- System now works with Community Edition without this constraint

⚠️  INFORMATIONAL: Neo4j Database Warnings

**Issue:**
Multiple warnings about missing properties and relationships:
- Property "normalized_name" not found in database
- Relationship type "MENTIONS" not found in database
- Property "created_at" not found in database

**Root Cause:**
These warnings are expected when the database is empty or doesn't yet contain
the expected data structure. They are informational, not errors.

**Status:**
These warnings are normal for an empty database and will disappear once
data is ingested through the data pipeline. No action required.

⚠️  CONFIGURATION: LLM API Key Missing

**Issue:**
Error: "LLM_API_KEY not configured" (lines 77-78)

**Root Cause:**
Environment variable LLM_API_KEY is not set.

**Required Action:**
Set the LLM_API_KEY environment variable with a valid API key for your LLM provider.
Example: export LLM_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

**Status:** Backend runs but cannot generate LLM responses without this configuration.

**Summary:**
✅ Critical constraint error fixed - backend now compatible with Neo4j Community Edition
⚠️  Database warnings are normal for empty database
⚠️  LLM API key configuration required for full functionality
