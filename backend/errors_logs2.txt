Backend F-String Syntax Error Fixed - 2025-07-06

✅ FIXED: Python F-String Syntax Error in Neo4j Retriever

**Issue:** 
SyntaxError: f-string: expecting '=', or '!', or ':', or '}' on line 219

**Root Cause:**
Neo4j Cypher count{} syntax conflicted with Python f-string curly brace syntax.
The count{(c)-[:MENTIONS]->()} was interpreted as invalid f-string expression.

**Solution Applied:**
- Escaped curly braces in f-string by doubling them: count{{...}}
- Fixed line 219: count{{(c)-[:MENTIONS]->()}} as entity_count
- Fixed line 320: count{{(connected)-[]->()}} + count{{(connected)<-[]->()}} as connection_count

**Verification:**
✅ Neo4j retriever module imports successfully
✅ Full import chain from main.py works without errors
✅ Backend can now start without Python syntax errors

**Status:** Critical syntax error resolved. Backend ready for operation.

**Technical Details:**
- Python f-strings use curly braces {} for variable interpolation
- To include literal curly braces in f-strings, they must be doubled: {{ }}
- Neo4j 5.x count{} syntax now properly escaped in Python f-strings
