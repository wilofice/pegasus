# Data Pipeline Migration to Backend v2 Integration

## Overview

The data_pipeline has been updated to integrate with the latest backend API improvements, including Celery task-based processing, job tracking, and enhanced monitoring capabilities.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **backend_integration.py Updates**

#### Celery Task Integration
- **Removed**: Direct call to `process_audio_file()` (deprecated)
- **Added**: `_trigger_transcription_task()` method that:
  - Creates ProcessingJob records for tracking
  - Dispatches Celery transcription tasks
  - Tracks task IDs for monitoring

#### Enhanced Status Monitoring
- **Updated**: `get_processing_status()` now includes job information
- **Added**: `get_job_progress()` method for detailed job tracking
- **Added**: Progress percentages and job completion metrics

#### Improved Error Handling
- **Added**: Comprehensive error logging and exception handling
- **Added**: Job status tracking for failed operations
- **Added**: Graceful degradation when services are unavailable

### 2. **pipeline_v2.py Enhancements**

#### Progress Monitoring
- **Added**: `monitor_job_progress()` async method
- **Added**: Real-time job status checking
- **Added**: Completion detection for multiple jobs

#### Better Integration
- **Updated**: Enhanced webhook notifications with job information
- **Added**: Timestamp tracking for processing events

### 3. **pipeline_manager.py CLI Tool**

#### New Commands
- **Added**: `jobs <audio_id>` - View detailed job progress
- **Enhanced**: `process` command shows job tracking instructions
- **Enhanced**: Status reporting includes job completion metrics

#### Enhanced Output
- **Added**: Progress percentages for job completion
- **Added**: Job-level error reporting
- **Added**: Real-time status indicators (✅/❌/⏳)

## Migration Benefits

### 1. **Improved Reliability**
- Celery tasks provide better error handling and retry mechanisms
- Job tracking ensures no processing steps are lost
- Better visibility into processing failures

### 2. **Enhanced Monitoring**
- Real-time progress tracking at job level
- Detailed error reporting with timestamps
- Complete audit trail of processing steps

### 3. **Better Integration**
- Full compatibility with backend's processing pipeline
- Shared job tracking and status reporting
- Consistent error handling across systems

### 4. **Scalability**
- Leverages Celery's distributed task processing
- Better resource management through backend's task queue
- Improved concurrency handling

## Usage Examples

### Processing a File
```bash
# Process an audio file
python pipeline_manager.py process audio_file.mp3

# Output:
# ✅ Successfully started processing: 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000
# You can check status with: python pipeline_manager.py check-status 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000
# You can monitor jobs with: python pipeline_manager.py jobs 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000
```

### Monitoring Job Progress
```bash
# Check detailed job progress
python pipeline_manager.py jobs 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000

# Output:
# === Job Progress for 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000 ===
# Total Jobs: 2
# Completed: 1
# Failed: 0
# Progress: 1/2 (50.0%)
#
# === Job Details ===
# ✅ TRANSCRIPTION - COMPLETED
#    ID: 456e7890-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174001
#    Started: 2023-12-07T10:30:00
#    Completed: 2023-12-07T10:32:15
#
# ⏳ PROCESSING - RUNNING
#    ID: 789e0123-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174002
#    Progress: 75%
#    Started: 2023-12-07T10:32:20
```

### Checking Overall Status
```bash
# Check file processing status
python pipeline_manager.py check-status 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000

# Output includes full status with job information
```

## Configuration Compatibility

The data_pipeline now fully inherits all backend settings:
- Database connections
- Celery configuration
- Processing timeouts
- Storage paths
- Model configurations

## Backwards Compatibility

- **pipeline.py**: Original pipeline still works (legacy mode)
- **pipeline_v2.py**: Enhanced pipeline with new features
- **Automatic fallback**: Graceful degradation if backend services unavailable
- **Configuration**: Existing config files remain compatible

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Verify integration with your specific backend setup
2. **Migration**: Consider switching from pipeline.py to pipeline_v2.py
3. **Monitoring**: Use the new job tracking features for better visibility
4. **Optimization**: Leverage Celery's distributed processing capabilities

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Job tracking not working**: Ensure backend database is accessible
2. **Celery tasks not starting**: Check Celery worker is running
3. **Status reporting errors**: Verify backend API connectivity

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check pipeline configuration
python pipeline_manager.py status

# List recent processed files
python pipeline_manager.py list-recent

# Check individual job details
python pipeline_manager.py jobs <audio_id>
```

The data_pipeline is now fully integrated with the backend's latest Celery-based processing architecture, providing better reliability, monitoring, and scalability.
